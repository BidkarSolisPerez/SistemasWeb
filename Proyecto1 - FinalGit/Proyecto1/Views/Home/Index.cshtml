        <h2>Luxury Cars</h2>
        <p>
            A luxury vehicle is intended to provide passengers (and often the driver) with increased comfort, a higher level of equipment and increased perception of quality than regular cars (such as economy cars, which are intended as basic low-cost transportation devices) for an increased price. The term is subjective and can be based on either the qualities of the car itself or the brand image of its manufacturer.[1] Luxury brands are considered to have a higher status than premium brands,[2] however there is no fixed differentiation between the two.

        <h2>Sport Cars</h2>
        <p>
            A sports car is designed to emphasise handling, performance or thrill of driving. Sports cars originated in Europe in the early 1900s
            and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.

        <h2>Classic Cars</h2>
        <p>
            A classic car is an older automobile; the exact definition varies around the world. The common theme is of an older car with enough historical interest to be collectable and worth preserving or restoring rather than scrapping.

            Cars 20 years and older typically fall into the classic class.

            Organizations such as the Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) and the Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) maintain a list of eligible unmodified cars that are called "classic". These are described as "fine" or "distinctive" automobile, either American or foreign built, produced between 1915 and 1948.
